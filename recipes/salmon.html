    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Salmon is baked in a lemon dill butter sauce for this wonderful (and easy) recipe I got from my aunt. The 
        flavors really complement the fish here. I like to use wild Alaskan salmon for this recipe, but any salmon 
        will work. I usually don't measure, so these are all estimates. Play with the ingredients to suit your own tastes!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound salmon fillets</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place salmon in the baking dish. Mix butter and lemon juice in a small bowl, and drizzle over salmon. Season with dill, garlic powder, sea salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until salmon is easily flaked with a fork, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
